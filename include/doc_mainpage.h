/** 
 * @mainpage Robot Pathfinding Project
 * 
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * This project is a 2D simulation of a robot navigating a grid-based map using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
 * Users can define start and goal tiles, place obstacles, and visualize the path and robot movement.
 * 
 * @section features_sec Features
 * - SFML for 2D rendering
 * - Tile-based map generation
 * - Graph construction
 * - Dijkstra pathfinding
 * - Sensor simulation and local map
 * 
 * @section usage_sec Usage
 * Compile the project and launch the executable. Click to set start, goal, and obstacles.
 * Press 'E' to run the pathfinding.
